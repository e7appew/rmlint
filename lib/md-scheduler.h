/**
 * @file md-scheduler.h
 * @brief Multi-disk scheduler/optimiser API for IO related tasks.
 *
 * A multi-disk scheduler for improving speed of IO-related tasks.
 * Tasks pushed to the scheduler are sorted according to associated
 * physical disk/device.  A worker thread is created for each physical
 * disk.
 *
 * Tasks sent to each worker thread are queued and processed in order
 * according to a prioritisation function (eg an elevator algorithm
 * based on disk offsets).
 *
 * Device workers are reference-counted, which may be useful eg in cases
 * where there are known future tasks on a device, eg tasks which can't
 * be started until other tasks have completed.
 *
 * Typical workflow:
 *
 *     RmMDS *mds = rm_mds_new(task_callback, max_threads, sorter, user_data);
 *     while (task) {
 *         rm_mds_push_path(mds, path, task_user_data);
 *     }
 *     rm_mds_free(mds);
 *
 *
 * If the tasks inode, dev and disk are known,
 * then rm_mds_push_dev(mds, disk, dev, node, user_data) may be
 * used instead of rm_mds_push_path().
