/**
 * @file hasher.h
 * @brief High level API for file hashing
 *
 * Provides a high-level API for rmlint's low-level checksum.h API.
 *
 * File reading is done in the foreground thread (multi-threading of
 * file reading is generally a bad idea because it tends to lead to
 * disk thrash for rotational disks, and gives little or no benefit
 * for non-rotational devices.
 *
 * File checksum calculation is done in one or more background threads,
 * so that file reading can proceed uninterrupted.  This should give
 * faster performance than conventional (single-threaded) checksum
 * calculating utilities
