Description: Extremely fast tool to remove filesystem lint
 rmlint finds space waste and other broken things on your filesystem
 and offers to remove them.
 .
 It is able to find:
  * Duplicate files & directories.
  * Non-stripped binaries.
  * Broken symlinks.
  * Empty files.
  * Recursive empty directories.
  * Files with broken user or group ID.
 .
 Key Features:
  * Extremely fast.
  * Flexible and easy command-line options.
  * Choice of several hashes for hash-based duplicate detection.
  * Option for exact byte-by-byte comparison (only slightly slower).
  * Numerous output options.
